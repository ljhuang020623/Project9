# Project 9 üìù

For Project 9 To Do List Ultra Pro we have been tasked with creating To-Do List application where the user is able to enter a minimum of twenty daily tasks.

## Features

- The user is initially prompted to create an account by entering their email and password to get into the to do list application
- Once the user is in the application, tasks are shown in a RecyclerView without empty task slots being shown
- An add button allows the user to add a new task to their day 
- When a task is chosen, a new screen is displayed that allows user to mark as complete, cancel out of the screen, or switch between the next or previous task.
- Mark as complete removes the task from the RecyclerView.
- The home screen of the app allows the user to logout of the signed in user.
- The home screen also includes a search task bar where users can search through their tasks.
- Everytime the user closes the app or pauses, the app asks the user to sign in again. 

## Github Contributions

Both partners have made contributions to the github repository and both partners worked together in completing the kotlin documentation and this README file.
