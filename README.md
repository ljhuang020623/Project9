# MidtermProject

For our Midterm Project we have been tasked with creating To-Do List application where the user is able to enter a limit of seven daily tasks.

## Features

- Tasks are shown in a RecyclerView without empty task slots being show
- An add button allows the user to add a new task to their day (if there are seven, the task button is updated to display a message)
- When a task is chosen, a new screen is displayed that allows user to mark as complete, cancel out of the screen, or switch between the next or previous task.
- Mark as complete removes the task from the RecyclerView.
- The application also includes an "About Activity" button to provide some information about the application and its developers.
- When the app is closed and reopened, last saved tasks are to appear.
