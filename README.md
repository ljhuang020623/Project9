# Project 9

For our Project 9 we have been tasked with creating To-Do List application where the user is able to enter a limit of seven daily tasks.

## Features

- The app requires users to create an account when they use it for the first time.
- Users must sign in every time the app becomes invisible or is no longer in the foreground.
- The main activity includes a logout button for users to sign out manually.
- Tasks are shown in a RecyclerView without empty task slots being shown.
- An add button allows the user to add a new task (if a task limit is reached, the add button is updated to display a message like “Too much work!”).
- When a task is chosen, a new screen is displayed that allows the user to mark it as complete, cancel out of the screen, or switch between the next or previous task.
- Marking a task as complete removes it from the RecyclerView.
- The main activity shows a search box and a search button that allow the user to filter tasks based on exactly matching a given string with task names.
